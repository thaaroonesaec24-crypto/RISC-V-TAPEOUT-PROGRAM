## 1. INTRODUCTION TO IVERILOG
#### Simulator
* RTL design is validated by simulating its behavior to ensure it adheres to the specifications.
* The simulation tool used in this program is Icarus Verilog (iverilog).

#### Design 
* The design refers to the Verilog code or collection of Verilog modules.
* It implements the intended functionality to satisfy the required specifications.

#### Testbench
* A testbench is used to provide test inputs (stimuli) to the design.
* It simulates the input signals and monitors the designâ€™s output to ensure correct functionality.
* Note that a testbench does not have any primary input or output ports.

#### Verilog-based Simulation Flow
* Write the Design (RTL Verilog module) and a Testbench to provide input stimuli and monitor outputs.
* Compile both files using the iverilog tool to generate a simulation executable.
* Run the executable to produce a Value Change Dump (VCD) file recording signal transitions.
* Open the VCD file with gtkwave to visually analyze and debug signal behavior for correctness.

## 2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP
* Create a new folder named VSD
  
* Open the terminal inside the VSD folder and navigate into it to verify that all files are correctly stored.
  ~~~
  cd VSD
* Clone the workshop repository
   ~~~
   git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git

## 3. SIMULATION PROCESS
* Providing the RTL design and its corresponding testbench as inputs to the Iverilog simulator.

* Generating the Value Change Dump (VCD) file and visualizing it using GTKWave.

* Displaying the simulation waveform using GTKWave for visual analysis.

* Execute the following command to view both the tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v code.
  ~~~
  gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v

## 4. INTRODUCTION TO YOSYS
 #### What is yosys?
  * Yosys is a tool used for converting the RTL Drsign to Netlist.

#### Verification of Synthesis
  * Testbench used is same as the RTL testbench.

* If the output is same as RTL output the netlist file is correct.

## 5. Yosys Synthesis flow

  This workflow illustrates performing RTL-to-gate-level synthesis using the Yosys open synthesis suite along with the sky130_fd_sc_hd standard cell library.
  
#### Step 1 : Inovoke Yosys
~~~
 yosys
~~~
![Tools Check](https://github.com/thaaroonesaec24-crypto/RISC-V-TAPEOUT-PROGRAM/blob/main/Week_1/Pictures/yosys%20invoke.png)
#### Step 2 : Read Liberty File
  You are loading the Liberty file for the Sky130 standard cell library, which is essential for mapping the synthesized netlist to technology-specific cells.
~~~
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
~~~
![Tools Check](https://github.com/thaaroonesaec24-crypto/RISC-V-TAPEOUT-PROGRAM/blob/main/Week_1/Pictures/readliberty.png)
#### Step 3 : Read RTL Verilog
You are loading the Verilog file containing your RTL design, and if it is read successfully, you should see the message "Successfully finished verilog frontend."
~~~
read_verilog good_mux.v
~~~
![Tools Check](https://github.com/thaaroonesaec24-crypto/RISC-V-TAPEOUT-PROGRAM/blob/main/Week_1/Pictures/read%20verilog.png)
#### Step 4 : Synthesize the top-level module 
You are synthesizing the top module, transforming the RTL design into a gate-level netlist that is independent of the target technology.
~~~
synth -top good_mux
~~~
![Tools Check](https://github.com/thaaroonesaec24-crypto/RISC-V-TAPEOUT-PROGRAM/blob/main/Week_1/Pictures/synth.png)
#### Step 5 : Map synthesized RTL to standard cells 
You are converting the synthesized netlist into a technology-dependent netlist by mapping it to the standard cells specified in the Liberty file.
~~~
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
~~~

#### Step 6 : View synthesized netlist as a schematic
You can display the synthesized netlist as a schematic diagram, which visually represents the logic implemented by the synthesis tool.
~~~

~~~

#### step 7 : Write the synthesized gate-level netlist 
You are exporting the synthesized gate-level netlist to a Verilog file while omitting attributes to keep the code clean and more readable.
~~~
 write_verilog -noattr good_mux_netlist.v
