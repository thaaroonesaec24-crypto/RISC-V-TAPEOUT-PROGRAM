# INTRODUCTION TO TIMING LIBRARIES

 A .lib file (Liberty file) is a text-based technology library that defines the functionality, timing, power, and area of standard cells, and is used in synthesis, timing, and power analysis.

## what is PVT?
Three key factors that affect how a circuit
 p -> process.

 v -> voltage.
 
 T -> Temperature.

 ## What is sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib?
 The file sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib is a Liberty timing library for the SkyWater 130nm (sky130) standard cell library.
